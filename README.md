## Assignment Reflection

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?

Shakila Jafari- I really enjoyed working on this assignment and figuring out how to test and fix things in the code. It was interesting to see how dictionaries actually work behind the scenes and how something that seems so simple to us, like searching for a word, involves so many detailed steps and cases in the program.
