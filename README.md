## Assignment Reflection

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?

Shakila Jafari- I really enjoyed working on this assignment and figuring out how to test and fix things in the code. It was interesting to see how dictionaries actually work behind the scenes and how something that seems so simple to us, like searching for a word, involves so many detailed steps and cases in the program.

Kiara Sunil Singh - I really enjoyed this assingment and learning more about hash sets. I also enjoyed working with the string builder and understanding more about the string builder's different functions. Initially, I did have challenges implementing the logic correctly, but it was super helpful being able to think it through. I did find the insturctions to be a little unclear, but overall this assignment was very helpful.
