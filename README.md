## Assignment Reflection

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?

Shakila Jafari- I really enjoyed working on this assignment and figuring out how to test and fix things in the code. It was interesting to see how dictionaries actually work behind the scenes and how something that seems so simple to us, like searching for a word, involves so many detailed steps and cases in the program.

Kiara Sunil Singh - I really enjoyed this assingment and learning more about hash sets. I also enjoyed working with the string builder and understanding more about the string builder's different functions. Initially, I did have challenges implementing the logic correctly, but it was super helpful being able to think it through. I did find the insturctions to be a little unclear, but overall this assignment was very helpful.

Chiashi Yang - I enjoyed working on this assignment. I learned more about hashsets, how to use them, and how it's distinguished from hash tables. I found the constructor to be the most challenging, especially when it came to finding a method to rid each word of any punctuation. I referenced the article given in the instructions but still had difficulty understanding the terms, so I had to do some extra research on what each part meant. However, I learned a lot by doing this. I found the testing of the different use cases and actually parsing the file to add the words to the hashset dictionary to be the most interesting. 

Victoria Reyes Borges - I enjoyed playing aroung with hash tables and how we can use them. I found the instructions to be a little difficult to understan which caused me to not get the logic right away. However, I was able to figure out my methods and enjoyed learning about this topic.
